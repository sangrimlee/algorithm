## Solution

```typescript filename="solution.ts" copy
export function numSteps(s: string): number {
  let answer = 0;
  let carry = 0;

  for (let i = s.length - 1; 0 < i; i--) {
    const bit = parseInt(s[i]);
    if (bit + carry === 1) {
      carry = 1;
      answer += 1;
    }
    answer += 1;
  }

  return answer + carry;
}
```
