## Solution

```typescript filename="solution.ts" copy
export function findMinArrowShots(points: number[][]): number {
  points.sort(([, end1], [, end2]) => end1 - end2);

  let totalArrowShot = 0;
  let lastPoint = 0;
  for (const [startPoint, endPoint] of points) {
    if (totalArrowShot === 0 || lastPoint < startPoint) {
      totalArrowShot += 1;
      lastPoint = endPoint;
    }
  }

  return totalArrowShot;
}
```
